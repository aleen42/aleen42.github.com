<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to My Page of Resume.</h3>

<p>I am always thinking how to perform myself to all of you, and absolutely there are so many ways for me to choose.</p>
<pre>/* Ways to choose: */<code>
- Bussiness Card
- Paper Curriculumn Vitae
- Personal Blog
- ...
</code></pre>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.github.com" title="GitHub" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, I can write this page to give all of me to you.</p>
<p>If you're using the GitHub, you can visit mine, <a href="https://www.github.com/aleen42" title="Aleen42's GitHub" target="_blank">Aleen</a>. I'm looking forward to your pulling requests to my projects.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h3>

<p>When it comes to my life, I am just a little kid born in Foshan, Guangdong in China. When I was 18, I chose to leave where I am familiar with, to go for my capus life in Xi'an, Shannxi. Xidian University is the place, in which I've learned my coding skills, as well as the design.</p>

<h3>
<a id="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>More Than A Coder?</h3>

<p>Why I say so? CODER is a word used to described the one who makes programs with specifical languages, and as far as I'm concerned, I wish to contribute more than a coder can. A book, named <a href="https://genius.com/Marc-andreessen-why-software-is-eating-the-world-annotated" target="_blank">"Why Software Is Eating The World"</a> written by <a href="https://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen" target="_blank">Marc Andreessen</a>, has inspired me that we can become more than a coder to change the world. What do I want to be? I would like to say it, a <b>Creator!</b></p>

<h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What kind of a company I prefer to?</h3>

<!--<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>-->

<p>Talking about a company, many people probably say that a company is the more huge, the better. The opinion is correct relatively, but not absolutely. A huge company can have much money used to develope, but at the same time, It will become much more complicated and uncontrollable. This is not the one I prefer to! What I prefer to is a light-weight company, a <b>Start-up Company</b>.</p>

<h3>
How to run a light-weight company?</h3>
<p>I would like to recommend you three articals about How GitHub works, written by an engineer in GitHub, Zach Holman. GitHub is huge? Nope, It's a company with not more than 100 employees or 0 raised money when building up.</p>
